SpellSword
==========

SpellSword is a Web text based RPG. It can be found at [http://www.devinfalgoust.com/spellsword](http://www.devinfalgoust.com/spellsword). It is currently being implemented in PHP using a MySQL database. Hopefully at some point I can convert it over to Java/JSP.

The premise of the game is that your character has no stats, he gains all of his stats by the equipment he is using. It is also a real-time game, gaining 1 token per hour that your character has been alive. Each token allows you to do things such as travel or battle.

Feel free to add items, quests, etc. to the SQL scripts if you'd like to see them added into the game.
